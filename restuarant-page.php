         Tony's Pizza specializes in pizza, calzones, and anything else Italian! Started by Tony Sr. in 1923, it became 
         very popular for its authentic Italian cusine. Tony came over from Venice in 1921, meaning it took him 
         about 2 years to realize there was no true Italian food in the United States.
